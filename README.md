===================

Code for reproducing SF3B1 study.

This repository is designed to allow for the replication of [XXX paper]
starting *after* some of the time intensive steps such as read-mapping,
expression estimation, etc.  Information on those steps is available in the

study.  Additional data are available from Figshare [XXX URL] and must be
downloaded before attempting to replicate the study.
